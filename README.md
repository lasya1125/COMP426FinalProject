# COMP426FinalProject

Our group is planning to create a website tailored towards those in need of healthier nutrition options. During these unprecedented times of covid, it is often difficult to find healthy food options. We want our website to target all individuals in need of healthier dietary options. The website will allow the user to create an account, input personal information, and choose nutrition options to output a meal to cook.
